                                <p>This is a call to order comrades. This article is not just a facile argument hidden behind revolutionary rhetoric! The time for change is here! No more n-tier architectures! No more service-layer business logic to suite the whims of the old guard! That all stops now!
                                </p>

                                <h1>So you think you code in OO?</h1>


                                <p>So. Do you? ...Or are you writing anaemic objects? Is your business logic sitting somewhere on the implementation of some “service interface”? Are you repeatedly touching (dirtying) the data while passing it through several layers of code?
                                </p>

                                <p>Face it. If you work as a Java Developer in South Africa at some place that is not a cool hipster dev-house, the likely-hood is that you are not writing OO code. The likely-hood is that you are writing some enterprise project code with seperate layers for Models, Views and Controllers.
                                </p>

                                <p>Are you aware that the people who originally documented the MVC pattern had no clue that future software architects would use their ideas as an excuse to separate state and behaviour and bludgeon OOP into a procedural architecture? To be fair, developer laziness has played a large part too. We allowed ourselves to be crippled by business specs that explain business as processes which has led to use cases which have led to service layer logic which has led to developer maintained semantic mayhem.
                                </p>
                                <p>The buck always ends at home. Quote me.
                                </p>

                                <h1>Real MVC</h1>


                                <p>I'm certain that when the original authors of MVC explained it, they were talking about something much simpler than what we've made of it. In fact, I argue that they envisioned Models, Views and Controllers as components of a more atomic entity such as domain object, as opposed to being components of the domain itself.
                                </p>

                                <p>At coding military school we were taught that an object has state and behaviour (what? You didn't go to coding military school? Shame.). MVC is actually just a finer definition of an object i.e. an object has a Model, Views, and Controllers.
                                </p>

                                <p>The object's Model is encapsulated by its Views and its Controllers, bitches.
                                </p>

                                <h1>DDD = Semantics</h1>


                                <p>Once you've accepted that you have not deployed a single line of truly object oriented code into production your entire career, you realise that you must introspect further about DDD. “Do I really understand it?” “Do I really understand it's implications?” But let me save you the trouble:
                                </p>

                                <p>DDD is about the semantics of code. It attempts to make our objects a lot more meaningful than they currently are, thus creating an application “space” where an ecosystem of meaningful objects enables various use-cases as opposed to implementing each one as a procedure.
                                </p>

                                <p>DDD holds that what makes code work is a strong understanding of the domain. It tries to reflect the domain more closely by insisting on a closer relationship to the business domain in the code. This is impossible without the clearer lines of responsibility that come with reuniting an object's state with it's behaviour.
                                </p>

                                <p>Again we see that DDD may be yet another finer definition of OO. One that is agitating the battle for clearer semantics in our code. It speaks to the core principles of OO, seeking better abstractions for better inheritance hierarchies and more meaningful polymorphism.
                                </p>

                                <h1>The struggle for meaning</h1>


                                <p>Because seriously, the technical problems have been solved a thousand times over. If you're still writing boilerplate code and shamelessly collecting your pay-check, then congratulations, you are the bad guy in the struggle for meaningful code.
                                </p>

                                <p>Around 2003 a man named Pawsons came up with a philosophy of software architecture which he called Naked Objects. He insisted that behaviourally complete objects already have everything you need to create the full enterprise application stack. No more need for n-tier crap.
                                </p>

                                <p>He did a case study to show that when your domain is built with behaviourally complete objects, one could write framework code that manages persistence and generates the screens needed to administrate the persistent entities. This framework would successfully take care of everything but the domain model, leaving no room for boilerplate code.
                                </p>

                                <p>The results of his case study aside, Pawsons is a hero in the struggle for meaning in our code. For too long developers have been saddled with all the technical issues around n-tier crap and procedural code masked as service layers. I argue that developers should no longer need to be technical and should solely deal with semantics.
                                </p>

                                <h1>Enter Apache Isis</h1>


                                <p>Apache Isis is a relatively new Java framework based on the Naked Objects philosophy. It does a great job of simplifying everything outside of the domain model. I suggest you take it out for a spin and see what it buys you.
                                </p>

                                <p>But do not for a second believe that all your problems are gone. Domain modelling is actually pretty hard. It requires developers to come out of their shells and really talk to and understand business. It requires a level of abstract thinking that is at once graceful and practical. The domain needs to be durable and forward thinking in nature so that it easy to learn and is easily extensible.
                                </p>

                                <p>You will be dealing with new challenges such as bounded contexts, context maps, root aggregates and ubiquitous language. This is not for the light-hearted and might have you missing your service layers and you Data Access Objects.
                                </p>

                                <p>But come friends, let us at least try
                                </p>

                                <p>The world of IT is cut-throat. People's careers and livelihoods rise and fall with various technologies and even frameworks. CIOs often make sweeping IT decisions based on criteria that we developers have no understanding of, but have to implement anyway. I say that we must rise up and insist on some basic rights!
                                </p>

                                <p>So, without any further delay, I present the software developer's freedom charter ():
                                </p>
                                <p>We refuse to stagnate in old thinking just because it is the status quo and “it works”.
                                </p>
                                <p>We refuse to be so far from the coalface of IT advancements that we spend our precious weekends watching you tube videos of other IT proffessionals do amazing things while we grapple with connection pools and JSF 1.2.
                                </p>
                                <p>We want to be there when salesmen sell to the CIO (they should actually take the whole IT department out to lobster lunches).
                                </p>
                                <p>The road to freedom will be paved with our courage and nothing else. We must make a stand. And this is just the beginning!
                                </p>
